# N16 Remote
A small 10-key macropad for controlling my n16 wm setup

Features arrow keys, size up and down keys, three misc function keys, and a "capslock esque" key to modify their behavior (eg arrows: navigate -> move window)
Each switch is mounted north-facing for per-key north facing rgb, which can be used to show the leyer/modfier state or just to be rgb and flashy
